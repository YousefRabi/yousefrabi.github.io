Hi! I'm Yousef Rabi, a self-taught deep learning data scientist and Kaggle competitions master.

In this blog, I'll write about ideas in the computer vision and natural language processing deep learning literature.

I'll also write about Kaggle competitions I compete in and cool approaches I come across.
